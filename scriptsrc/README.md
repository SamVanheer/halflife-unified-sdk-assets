# Half-Life Unified SDK install scripts

This directory contains scripts used to create Half-Life Unified SDK mod packages and to install game content from official Valve games by copying it from a local installation.
These scripts are expected to be ran from the mod's scripts directory only.

Note: these scripts must work with PowerShell 5.1 as long as Windows 7 is supported by this project.
Make sure to run the scripts using a 5.1 terminal to verify that they work.
